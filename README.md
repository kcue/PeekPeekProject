# PeekPeek

## Getting Started

### Requirements & Dependencies
- Node & npm
- Vue-CLI

### Development Setup
1. Install node & npm
    On MacOS:
    On Windows:
    On Ubuntu:
        ```
            $ sudo apt update
            $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
            $ sudo apt install nodejs

            $ npm --version
        ```
2. Install Vue-CLI globally: `npm install -g vue-cli`
3. Go to project directory, and install project dependencies with: `npm install`
4. Start the local development server: `npm run serve`
5. You can view the site through the browser on `localhost:8080`

### Development Notes

- To lint the project and fix errors in formatting, run the command `npm run lint`.
- Once the local development server has started, any changes on the local project will update localhost immediately through hot-reloading.

## Deployment

### S3 Initialization
_More details can be found in AWS documentations (link below)_
1. Create an S3 Bucket
2. Set the S3 Bucket as public and enable ***Static Website Hosting***
3. If setting up the bucket for production, make sure to point the domain (with Route53 & CloudFront) to the appropriate S3 bucket.
4. If pushing code directly from one's local machine, make sure machine has `aws-cli` installed with permissions configured. 

### Pushing Project to S3 Bucket
1. Build the project
    ```
        $ npm run build
    ```
2. Push the project `dist` folder (generated by the build) to the S3 bucket
    ```
        $ aws s3 cp dist/ s3://<S3 bucket name> --recursive
    ```

## Section Breakdown
1. Home Section: `HomeSection.vue`
    * This section contains the tiny-world picture, as well as the opening text (“Welcome to Peek Peek & It’s All About You”) and the buttons labeled “Watch the video” and “Take a peek”.
    * **To change the picture**:
        Find the following code block in `HomeSection.vue`. Replace the img `src` with the new image’s name.
        ```html 
        <div class="home-pic">
            <img src="../assets/images/tinyWorld.png" />
        </div>
        ```
    * **To change the opening text (before animation)**:
        Find the following code block in `HomeSection.vue`. Replace the contents inside h1 with your desired text. (use `<br/>` to force the text onto the next line.)
        ```html <h1 id="splash-text">Welcome<br/>to<br/>PeekPeek</h1>```
    * **To change the opening text (after animation)**:
        Find the following code block in `HomeSection.vue`. Replace the contents inside h1 with your desired text. (use `<br/>` to force the text onto the next line.)
        ```html 
        <div class="secondary hidden">
            <h1>It's all<br/>about you.</h1>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        ```
    * **To change the links or text on either button**: 
        Find the following code block in `HomeSection.vue`. Replace the contents inside the `a` tag to change the label on the button. Replace the link in the `href` with the desired new link.
        ```html 
        <div class="home-section-buttons">
            <button>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4EEhXH_pz0">Watch video</a>
            </button>
            <button>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peekpeek.com/industries">Take a peek</a>
            </button>
        </div>
        ```
2. Stats Section: `StatsSection.vue`
    * This section contains the moving statistic cards, as well as the text “We do work better than most, actually” and “New challenge? New solution”.
    * **To change the data on the cards**:
    * Find the following code block in `StatsSection.vue`. This section contains all the data for each card. The first entry is the lowest on the page. You can add additional entries to this object, but the animation was designed for only four (4) entries and additional data may cause unintended effects.
    ```javascript
    data() {
        return {
            cardData: [
                    {
                        cardNumber: '18x',
                        supportiveTitle: 'Longer',
                        title: 'Duration of Stay',
                    },
                    {
                        cardNumber: '130%',
                        supportiveTitle: 'Increase in',
                        title: 'Booking Rate',
                    },
                    {
                        cardNumber: '12%',
                        supportiveTitle: 'Increase in',
                        title: 'Engagement Rate',
                    },
                    {
                        cardNumber: '28%',
                        supportiveTitle: 'Conversion of',
                        title: 'Physical Visit',
                    },
                ]
            }
        }
    ```
* **To change the text on “We do work better than most, actually”**:
* Find the following code block in `StatsSection.vue`. Replace the `h4` and `h2` tags with your desired text. The `h2` is bolder text while the `h4` is lighter text. They move different speeds when parallaxing so it important to have both if you change the text.
    ```html
    z<div class="stats-titles">
        <h2 class="title" id="work">We do work</h2>
        <h4 class="subtitle" id ="better">better than most, actually</h4>
    </div>
    ```
* **To change the text on “New challenge? New solution”**:
* Find the following codeblock in `StatsSection.vue`. Replace the content in each `p` section. The `i` tag creates the arrow next to the text and can be removed if so desired.
    ```html
    <div class="stats-text">
        <p class="main-text" id="challenge">New challenge?</p>
        <p class="main-text" id="solution">New solution <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i></p>
    </div>
    ```
3. Video Section: `VideoSection.vue`
    * This section contains the large video and the words “It’s the full experience".
    * **To change the video**:
    * Find the following code block in `VideoSection.vue`. Replace the `src` on the iframe. It is recommended that you leave the link and only add the video’s code. For example, if the video you wanted was located at the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4EEhXH_pz0 , the video’s code would be `s4EEhXH_pz0`. Add that after https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/.
        ```html
        <div class="video-section-container">
            <iframe class = "media"
                    id = "firstVideo"
                    width="100%" 
                    height="100%"
            src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s4EEhXH_pz0" 
                    frameborder="0" 
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
                    allowfullscreen=""
                    scrolling="no"></iframe>
        ```
    * **To change the text below the video**:
    * Find the following code block in `VideoSection.vue`. Replace all of the content inside the `h2` tag with your desired text.

    <h2 class="wide-title" id="fullexperience">It's the full <b>experience</b></h2>
    ```
4. Hotspots Section: `HotspotsSection.vue`
    * This section contains the text “It’s not just a place, tell me about your story with spotlights.” It also contains the animated skyline gif or movie. 
    * **To change the text**:
    * Find the following code block in `HotspotsSection.vue`. Replace the `h4` and `h2` tags with your desired text. The `h2` is bolder text while the `h4` is lighter text. They move different speeds when parallaxing so it important to have both if you change the text.
        ```html         
        <div class="hotspot-titles">
                    <h4 class="subtitle" id="space">It's not just the space</h4>

        ```javascript
            data() {
                return {
                    imagePath: funct ion (name:string): any {

            </span>
        </li>
        ```


## Recommendations for Future Updates
- 

## Other Notes
- To keep the project organized, it is recommended you put any images you want on the website inside the folder under `./src/assets/images/`. If this is done, then changing a specific picture will only require changing the filename and not the entire path.

- On Animation Tweens:
  - If a tween isn’t moving even though the console isn’t throwing any errors, then the most likely scenario is that the element does not have an ID. If the element doesn’t have an ID, then scrollmagic can’t add styling to it.

- On CSS Precedence:
  - If you make a change to the CSS, and it doesn’t effect the element, make sure that there are no `!important` attributes being assigned to that element. Some breakpoints set attributes as “!important” to override traditional css precedences
  - All Page type vue SCSS are `scoped`. If you make a CSS change, given that the correct selectors were provided, it may also be due to scoping issues. You can use the `v-deep` directive to mitigate these issues.
